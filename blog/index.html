			<h2>A New Blog, A New Day</h2>
			<time>October 29, 2014</time>
			<p>Ahh, a new Blog. This is my second attempt at blogging. However this time I am going at it alone. No more Wordpress and it's Wordpress templates. Just pure clean static blog content. I plan on using Hugo, but for this first post it's all being done by hand using Brackets. Wish me luck!
			</p>
			<p>	The topic of the posts will be inevitably be about Web Application Development, since that is how I spend most of my time.
			</p>
			<p>My motivations for creating a blog in this day and age are several. Foremost amongst them is creating a portfolio so I can land a job at Google. Yes, it's that simple. Someone, anyone, know someone at Google that is looking to hire an all around Developer? Someone intimately familiar with Java, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Mobile Apps and a whole lot in between? Please drop me a line and have them call me for an interview :).</p>
