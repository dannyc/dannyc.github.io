		<section>Naturally Curious<br>
Passionate Technologist<br>
Perpetual Learner<br>
<p>When I was 12 my father showed me a book "Programming in Basic" and I've been teaching myself programming ever since. I love challenges that require me to think. I love learning new technologies, new API's, and dreaming how I can change the world using a computer.</p>
<p>For about 8 years I've been working professionally as a full-stack Java web developer. I have experience in a large enterprise company (16,000+ employees) and in a small 5 person startup. Currently I am leading the R&amp;D team for a mid-size software company.</p>
I earned a B.Sc. from a small University in New York City.
